Welcome to Geometry Processing! The purpose of this assignment will be to get
you up and running with the two C++ libraries we will be using:
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for dense and sparse linear algebra
routines and [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl) for geometry processing
routines. We will make use of the OpenGL-based viewer used by the [libigl
tutorial](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html). This viewer
also depends on [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/download.html), a library for
managing windows on Linux, Mac OS X and windows.

## Prerequisite installation

On all platforms, we will assume you have installed cmake and a modern c++
compiler on Mac OS X[¹](#¹macusers), Linux[²](#²linuxusers), or
Windows[³](#³windowsusers).

We also assume that you have cloned this repository using the `--recursive`
flag (if not then issue `git submodule update --init --recursive`). 

## Layout

All assignments will have a similar directory and file layout:

    README.md
    CMakeLists.txt
    main.cpp
    include/
      function1.h
      function2.h
      ...
    src/
      function1.cpp
      function2.cpp
      ...
    shared/
      libigl/
        include/
          igl/
            ...
      ...

The `README.md` file will describe the background, contents and tasks of the
assignment.

The `CMakeLists.txt` file setups up the cmake build routine for this
assignment.

The `main.cpp` file will include the headers in the `include/` directory and
link to the functions compiled in the `src/` directory. This file contains the
`main` function that is executed when the program is run from the command line.

The `include/` directory contains one file for each function that you will
implement as part of the assignment. **_Do not change_** these files.

The `src/` directory contains _empty implementations_ of the functions
specified in the `include/` directory. This is where you will implement the
parts of the assignment.

The `shared/` directory will contain shared resources: cmake files, dependences
(e.g., libigl) and data. Feel free to poke around in here, but you shouldn't
change any of these files.

## Compilation

This and all following assignments will follow a typical cmake/make build
routine. Starting in this directory, issue:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make 

Why don't you try this right now?

## Execution

Once built, you can execute the assignment from inside the `build/` using 

    ./introduction

After [compiling according to the instructions above](#compilation), if you try
executing right now, then you'll see a bunny:

![Screenshot of viewer displaying a bunny](images/bunny-screenshot.jpg)

You can click and drag to change the view.

Optionally, this program can input a path to a triangle mesh file (other than
the bunny):

    ./introduction [path to input file]

## Background

> Every assignment, including this one, will start with a **Background**
> section. This will review the math and algorithms behind the task in the
> assignment. Students following the lectures should already be familiar with
> this material and may opt to skip this section.

Let's get familiar with the _explicit_ mesh representation of a discrete
surface immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Throughout the course, we will store the set of
mesh vertices $V$[⁴](#⁴latex) and the set of triangles (a.k.a.
faces) $F$ as two matrices: `V` and `F`.

The matrix `V` is $|V|$ by 3 in size, where the ith row of this matrix contains
the x-, y- and z-coordinates of the ith vertex of the mesh. 

The matrix `F` is $|F|$ by 3 in size, where the jth row of this matrix contains
the indices into the rows of `V` of the first, second and third corners of the
jth triangle as a non-negative number (remember in C++ arrays and matrices
start with index `0`). 

The information in `V` alone is purely positional and encodes the
_geometry_ of the surface.

The information in `F` alone is purely combinatoric and encodes the _topology_
of the surface. 

By convention, the indices in each row of `F` are _ordered_ counter-clockwise
around the triangle. Using the right-hand rule, we can define the normal of
each triangle as the vector that points _most away_ from the surface.

![The right-hand rule and the counterclockwise ordering convention defines the
normal of a triangle.](images/right-hand-rule.jpg)

Each oriented triangle also defines three _directed edges_ between its three
vertices. Other triangles in the mesh may contain edges with the same incident
vertices, possibly in the opposite direction. A manifold mesh will have at most
two triangles incident on the same (undirected) _edge_, therefor we'll refer to
each triangle's directed edge as a _half-edge_.

![Two neighboring triangles may share the same (unoriented) edge (thick black).
In a consistently oriented mesh, these triangles' corresponding half-edges
(orange) will have opposite orientation.](images/half-edges.jpg)

The number of vertices $|V|$ and number of faces $|F|$ and number of unique
(undirected) edges $|E|$ are _intimately_ related. Adding a new triangle to a
mesh may mean increasing the number of vertices and edges, too. The algebraic
relationship between the number of vertices, edges and faces reveals the
topological _genus_ of the surface via the _Euler Characteristic_ 

$$
χ = 2c - 2h - b,
$$

where $c$ is the number of connected components, $h$ is number of
holes (as in donut), and $b$ is the number of connected components of the
boundary of the surface.

For meshes representing polyhedral surfaces, the Euler Characteristic can be
computed very simply:

```
Chi = |V| - |E| + |F|.
```

Assuming no _unreferenced_ vertices in `V`, each of the quantities in the
right-hand side can be determined from `F` alone. This indicates that its a
purely topological property. Changing the geometric positions (i.e., changing
the vertex positions in `V`) will not affect the Euler Characteristic. Due to
this, we say that the Euler Characteristic is a _topological invariant_.

## Tasks

Every assignment, including this one, will contain a **Tasks** section. This
will enumerate all of the tasks a student will need to complete for this
assignment. These tasks will match the header/implementation pairs in the
`include/`/`src/` directories.

### Groundrules

Libigl has implemented many of the tasks you'll find in this course. As a
result, for some assignments, including this one, you'll see a **Groundrules**
section that lists which functions you can and should use from libigl and/or
functions you may not use (and should avoid copying your answers from).

#### Blacklist libigl functions

For this assignment you may not use

 - `igl::all_edges`
 - `igl::edge_flaps`
 - `igl::edge_topology`
 - `igl::edges`
 - `igl::euler_characteristic`
 - `igl::exterior_edges`
 - `igl::is_boundary_edge`
 - `igl::unique_edge_map`
 - or any other libigl function that returns a list of edges.

### `src/edges.cpp`

From a list of triangles `F`, construct a $|E|$ by 2 matrix `E`, where the kth
row of this matrix contains the indices into the rows of `V` of the start and
end point of the kth edge in the mesh. `E` should contain every _undirected
edge_ exactly once. 

### `src/euler_characteristic.cpp`

From the list of triangles `F`, return the Euler Characteristic `X` of the
triangle mesh. You may and should use your `edges` function from the previous
task.

### Submission

Upload your `src/` files to Bloackboard to submit the assignment.
